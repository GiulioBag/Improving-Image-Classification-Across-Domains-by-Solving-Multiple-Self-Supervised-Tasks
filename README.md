# Improving Image Classification Across Domains by Solving Multiple Self-Supervised Tasks

Base code for performing experiments with a multi-task-selfsupervised network.

## Dataset
The experiments must be conducted on the PACS database.

1 - Download PACS dataset from here http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~dl307/project_iccv2017

2 - Put the database in the "Improving-Image-Classification-Across-Domains-by-Solving-Multiple-Self-Supervised-Tasks" folder

## Pretrained model
For the DG experiments, in order to reproduce exactly the values reported in the tables, you have to use the "caffe" pretrained model.

You can download it from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wUJTH1Joq2KAgrUDeKJghP1Wf7Q9w4z-/view?usp=sharing

Then, you have to put it into 

```
/Improving-Image-Classification-Across-Domains-by-Solving-Multiple-Self-Supervised-Tasks/models/pretrained/
```
